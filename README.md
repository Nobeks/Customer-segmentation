Project Description:
The project at Nexus Bank is aimed to harness the power of data to enhance the bank's operations and efficiency. As a Data Scientist, the primary objective was to analyze the bank's data and provide valuable insights to drive informed decision-making. By leveraging advanced analytics techniques, the goal was to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities within the data, leading to improved operational processes, enhanced customer experiences, and increased profitability. 
Project Steps:

    Data Collection: The first step involved gathering relevant data from various sources within the bank, such as transaction records, customer information and campaign informations carried out by the bank. This process required understanding the data schema and data quality assessment
    Data Exploration and Preparation: After collecting the data, it was necessary to explore and understand its structure, format, and relationships. Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering techniques were applied to prepare the data for further analysis. This step also involved handling missing values, outlier detection, and addressing data quality issues.
    Data Analysis and Modeling: Once the data was prepared, statistical analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling techniques were employed to extract meaningful insights. This involved applying algorithms for classification, regression or anomaly detection based on specific objectives defined by Nexus Bank. Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques were utilized to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data.
    Insights and Recommendations: The insights derived from the data analysis were translated into actionable recommendations. These recommendations aimed to optimize various aspects of the bank's operations such as customer segmentation, product development, and marketing strategies. The recommendations were presented in a clear and understandable manner to facilitate decision-making at the bank.
    Challenges faced:

    Data Quality: Ensuring data quality and integrity was a significant challenge. Data often had inconsistencies such as the total number of unknown category being the highest in previous marketing campaign .

    Data Integration: Integrating data from various systems and databases within the bank was complex. Ensuring data compatibility, resolving inconsistencies in data formats, and consolidating information from different sources required significant effort.
